        CSS

    <p>
        A CSS rule consists of selector, in this case it's a p, the paragraph tag, 
        which is basically saying that whatever rules I'm about to give should apply 
        to the content of every single paragraph tag in the entire HTML page. 
        The selector is followed by open and close curly braces. Inside of those braces, 
        we have CSS declaration. And it consist of two parts, the property and the value. 
        Property name is something that's predefined by CSS specification, and for every 
        property there is a set number of pre-defined values. Or in the case of numerical 
        values, set number of type of numerical values that is pre-defined. Now, every 
        property in the value is separated by a colon, 
        and is terminated by a semicolon. Now, technically speaking, a semicolon is not a 
        requirement, but it's a best practice, and you should always, always use it.
